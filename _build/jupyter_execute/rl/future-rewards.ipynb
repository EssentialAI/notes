    "# Future Rewards and Value functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this page, let's get more specific about what the agent does. We have previously talked about how our agent wants to maximize the reward. However, this is not specific enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an episode of time $T$, our true goal is to maximize the sum of total rewards over all the time-steps in the episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An important consideration in MDPs is that our actions only effect the future rewards, hence our aim become to maximize the sum of all future rewards from a given time-step.** If we are in the initial stage of the episode we want to maximize the sum of all the rewards over that episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the letter $G$ to represent the sum of future rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G(t) = R(t+1)+ R(t+2)+... = \\sum_{\\tau = 0}^{\\infty}R(t+\\tau +1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the reward function $R(t)$ is stochastic (random variable), then the reward function $G$ is also stochastic (random variable).**\n",
    "\n",
    "At any given time the goal of the agent is to maximize the return $G(t)$ that occur at all the future steps from $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL, the reward that we are looking for happens at the very end of the game or sometime in the far future. Examples are solving a maze or winning a game. You want the agent to plan the strategies to reach the goal. This strategy finding element is automatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discounting rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "One important addition to the reward functions is down-weighting rewards that are further into the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G(t) = R(t+1)+ \\gamma R(t+2)+ \\gamma ^2 R(t+3) ... = \\sum_{\\tau = 0}^{\\infty}\\gamma^\\tau R(t+\\tau +1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "_$\\gamma$ - discount factor_\n",
    "\n",
    "Another intuitive way to think about discounting is that \"the further you look into the future, the harder it becomes to predict the true reward.\" Discounting allows us to say that \"The near future is more important.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $\\gamma = 0$, the reward only depends on the next time-step. This can be called as a greedy strategy. We only care about the immediate reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $\\gamma = 1$, the reward depends on all the future time-steps equally. This is the closest to what we would want a perfect agent to account for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real purpose of using discounting is to improve the training process. If you have an environment that has very short [episodic-tasks](mdp.html#episodic-v-s-non-episodic-tasks) , then it might not be worth using discounting at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the values of the discounting factor $\\gamma$ are around $\\{0.9, 0.99, 0.999\\}$ and so on. $\\gamma$ is a hyperparameter and requires tuning. (use gridsearch)."

    "Let's reinitialize the fact that the goal of our agent is to maximize the sum of future rewards. How does the agent know what the sum of future rewards will be?\n",
    "\n",

(Assuming that the reward is defined as +1 if the agent reaches the goal position and -1 if the agent reaches the position below the goal position. (see figure above)).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other, if the agent follows a policy that always leads to the state that gives -1 reward, the sum of the future rewards will always be -1.\n",

    "The above example assumes returns to be deterministic. In case of stochastic environment, the transition function $p(s', r| s,a)$ makes the return stochastic.\n",

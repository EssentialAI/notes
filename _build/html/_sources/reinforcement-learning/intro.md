# Reinforcement Learning

This jupyter-book contains my notes for the CSE 546 Reinforcement Learning course during the Spring-2023 semester taught by Professor [Alina Vereshchaka](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~avereshc/).

**Course description**:
This course is intended for students interested in artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning in which an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and assessing the results. Reinforcement learning is the method by which Google DeepMind created the AlphaGo system that beat a high-ranking Go player and how AlphaStar became the first artificially intelligent system to defeat a top professional player in StarCraft II.

**How to navigate through these notes**:

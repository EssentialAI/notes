# Welcome to Notes @ Essential AI

This webpage is to keep track of my lecture notes during my Master's education at The State University of New York at Buffalo.

**The EssentialAI blog âœ’**
^^^

Not your generic Machine Learing blog. The EssentialAI blog aims at intuitively explaining the mathematics behind the ML models. The topics chosen for this blog are musings of a Data Scientist. Stay curious.

**Machine Learning models from scratch ðŸ§ **

^^^

What I cannot create, I do not understand. Deciphering several ML models is easier than one might assume. This section is aimed at implementing such ML models from scratch. Hoping to include implementation of research papers in the future.
